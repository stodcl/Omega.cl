        <section id="layout">
            <h1>Londinium layout is based on toggling classes in HTML code.</h1>
            <p>Here go most common layout options:</p>

            <h4>Hiding/showing sidebar</h4>
            Hidden sidebar is based on CSS3 animation and toggling <code>.sidebar-hidden</code> which is added to <code>.page-container</code> div. To hide sidebar and make it default just add this class manually to page container div and your sidebar will be hidden by default, you'll get a full width page. To show sidebar, click <code>.sidebar-toggle</code> button on top navbar. This button is hidden on &lt;992px screens.

            <h4>Left and right sidebars</h4>
            Default sidebar position is left. To show it on the right side, add <code>.sidebar-right</code> class to <code>body</code>. <br> By default <code>body</code> should have <code>.sidebar-wide</code> for showing wide sidebar or <code>.sidebar-narrow</code> for showing narrow sidebar. Both sidebars support left and right positions

            <h4>Wide and narrow sidebars</h4>
            Wide left sidebar is a default template sidebar. If you want to show on certain pages narrow sidebar, change <code>.sidebar-wide</code> in document body tag to <code>.sidebar-narrow</code>, no need to change any html sidebar markup. <br> <strong>Note:</strong> Londinium doesn't support dynamic sidebar replacement at the moment, for wide sidebar it uses Collapsible plugin for toggling children navigation levels, narrow sidebar children nav levels use pure css.

            <h4>Fixed navbar</h4>
            Default template navbar has absolute positioning. If you want to make it fixed, add <code>.navbar-fixed-top</code> to parent navbar div and add <code>.navbar-fixed</code> class to bodument body tag.

            <h4>Left aligned navigation icons</h4>
            Default template navigation icons position is right. To change their position to left, simply add <code>.navigation-icons-left</code> to <code>ul.navigation</code>.

            <h4>Bootstrap dropdown icons alignment</h4>
            There are 2 options for icon alignment - left and right. Default is left position, to change it to right, add <code>.icons-right</code> to <code>ul.dropdown-menu</code>, this class floats them to the right side.

            <p>Londinium is available in 2 columns layout version only. On small screens sidebar is hidden by default. To Show or Hide sidebar you need to click on the button on the top menu. After resizing to 992px and more, all layout elements become visible.</p>
            
            <h5>Icons</h5>
            <p>Londinium contains custom Icomoon icon font. Default usage is:</p>

                <pre class="brush: css">

            <h4>Responsive layout</h4>
            <p>Londinium includes media queries, it means that general layout changes general look depending on the screen resolution.</p>

            
            <p>All CSS files are well commented, so you can easily find and edit any style in any CSS file. If you don't want to use responsive layout, delete all media queries and don't forget to remove 
            <pre class="brush: html">
            	&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0" />

            from HTML files, this line prevents scaling in mobile device browsers.

            <h4>Note</h4>
            <p>All tables in the template are responsive, it works this way - all static tables should be wrapped by 
                <pre>&lt;div class="table-responsive">...&lt;/div></pre>
                and on small screens all tables will have horizontal scrolling inside block. All datatables are responsive by default.

            <h4>JS files inside HTML pages</h4>
            <p>In general each HTML page loads 30+ .js files. In your project you can minify all these files into 1 or do whatever you want, but in download package i included all files so you can easily edit/remove/add new files. And depending on the page you can include prettify.js file and mousewheel.js file, they don't have any functions in functions.js file, so i didn't include them to all pages
<br />Each JS file is in proper folder: all files, which are used for forms are placed in /forms/ folder, the same path is in HTML page:</p>
            <pre class="brush: html">

            </pre>

            <p>These files need to be included only in charts.html page:

                <pre class="brush: html">
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="js/plugins/charts/flot.js">&lt;/script>
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="js/plugins/charts/flot.orderbars.js">&lt;/script>

            </p>

            <p>Javascript files which contain jQuery Flot parameters load only on those pages, which have a graph. There is a well known flot issue with plot drawing, when parameters are loaded, but the chart isn't included to the page:
            <pre class="brush: html">

            </pre>
            </p>

            <p>Globalization files are needed for spinner input mostly:

            <h3>Jquery Plugins</h3>






            <hr class="notop">
            <p>List of Jquery plugins which were used in Londinium template, with details:</p>
            
            <h4>Dual select boxes (listbox)</h4>
            <h5>Overview</h5>
            <p>This plug-in allows you to "transfer" the &lt;option&gt; elements between the &lt;select&gt;s in two distinct ways:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Move</strong> - In this mode, &lt;option&gt; elements will be removed from the &lt;select&gt; in which they currently reside and moved to the other &lt;select&gt;. This is the default.</li>
              <li><strong>Copy</strong> - In this mode, items in the first &lt;select&gt; will ALWAYS remain in the first &lt;select&gt;(unless they are hidden by filtering). When they are selected for transfer they will be copied to the second &lt;select&gt; and will be given the class 'copiedOption' in the first &lt;select&gt; (my default styling for this class is yellow background but you may choose whatever styling suits you). If they are then transferred from the second &lt;select&gt;, they disappear from the second&lt;select&gt;, and the 'copiedOption' class is removed from the corresponding &lt;option&gt; in the first &lt;select&gt;.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h5>Options</h5>
            <p>The following table has a listing of all the possible option settings, their default values, their valid values, and a brief description of each.</p>

            <h4>Datatables</h4>
			<h5>Introduction</h5>
			<p>DataTables operates on the principle of progressive enhancement, whereby an enhanced and interactive table will be presented to the end user if their browser has the required capabilities. When you initialise the jQuery.dataTable object, information about the table is read directly from the HTML page. In combination with the default values for the features in DataTables, this makes it very easy to integrate directly into your web-site or web-application. Optionally, you can use the initialisation parameters to load data from locations other than the DOM, such as a server-side processing script or an Ajax obtained JSON file.</p>
			
            <h5>Features</h5>
			<p>By default the majority of features that DataTables provides are enabled, such that a richly interactive table is presented to end users. However, you may wish to disable various features to customise DataTables to your specific application. This is possible using the following initialisation parameters.</p>
			<table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5">
			  <tbody>
			    <tr>
			      <td width="114" valign="top"><strong>bAutoWidth</strong> <br></td>
			      <td width="1665" valign="top">Enable or disable automatic column width calculation. This can be disabled as an optimisation (it takes some time to calculate the widths) if the tables widths are passed in using aoColumns.</td>
		        </tr>
			    <tr>
			      <td valign="top"><strong>bDeferRender</strong> <br></td>
			      <td valign="top">Deferred rendering can provide DataTables with a huge speed boost when you are using an Ajax or JS data source for the table. This option, when set to true, will cause DataTables to defer the creation of the table elements for each row until they are needed for a draw - saving a significant amount of time.</td>
		        </tr>
			    <tr>
			      <td valign="top"><strong>bFilter</strong> <br></td>
			      <td valign="top">Enable or disable filtering of data. Filtering in DataTables is "smart" in that it allows the end user to input multiple words (space separated) and will match a row containing those words, even if not in the order that was specified (this allow matching across multiple columns). Note that if you wish to use filtering in DataTables this must remain 'true' - to remove the default filtering input box and retain filtering abilities, please use <a href="http://datatables.net/usage/options#sDom">sDom</a>.</td>
		        </tr>
			    <tr>
			      <td valign="top"><strong>bInfo</strong> <br></td>
			      <td valign="top">Enable or disable the table information display. This shows information about the data that is currently visible on the page, including information about filtered data if that action is being performed.</td>
		        </tr>
			    <tr>
			      <td valign="top"><strong>bJQueryUI</strong> <br></td>
			      <td valign="top">Enable jQuery UI ThemeRoller support (required as ThemeRoller requires some slightly different and additional mark-up from what DataTables has traditionally used).</td>
		        </tr>
			    <tr>
			      <td valign="top"><strong>bLengthChange</strong> <br></td>
			      <td valign="top">Allows the end user to select the size of a formatted page from a select menu (sizes are 10, 25, 50 and 100). Requires pagination (bPaginate).</td>
		        </tr>
			    <tr>
			      <td valign="top"><strong>bPaginate</strong> <br></td>
			      <td valign="top">Enable or disable pagination.</td>
		        </tr>
			    <tr>
			      <td valign="top"><strong>bProcessing</strong> <br></td>
			      <td valign="top">Enable or disable the display of a 'processing' indicator when the table is being processed (e.g. a sort). This is particularly useful for tables with large amounts of data where it can take a noticeable amount of time to sort the entries.</td>
		        </tr>
			    <tr>
			      <td valign="top"><strong>bScrollInfinite</strong> <br></td>
			      <td valign="top">Enable infinite scrolling for DataTables (to be used in combination with sScrollY). Infinite scrolling means that DataTables will continually load data as a user scrolls through a table, which is very useful for large dataset. This cannot be used with pagination, which is automatically disabled.</td>
		        </tr>
			    <tr>
			      <td valign="top"><strong>bSort</strong> <br></td>
			      <td valign="top">Enable or disable sorting of columns. Sorting of individual columns can be disabled by the "bSortable" option for each column.</td>
		        </tr>
			    <tr>
			      <td valign="top"><strong>bSortClasses</strong> <br></td>
			      <td valign="top">Enable or disable the addition of the classes 'sorting_1', 'sorting_2' and 'sorting_3' to the columns which are currently being sorted on. This is presented as a feature switch as it can increase processing time (while classes are removed and added) so for large data sets you might want to turn this off.</td>
		        </tr>
			    <tr>
			      <td valign="top"><strong>bStateSave</strong> <br></td>
			      <td valign="top">Enable or disable state saving. When enabled a cookie will be used to save table display information such as pagination information, display length, filtering and sorting. As such when the end user reloads the page the display display will match what thy had previously set up.</td>
		        </tr>
			    <tr>
			      <td valign="top"><strong>sScrollX</strong> <br></td>
			      <td valign="top">Enable horizontal scrolling. When a table is too wide to fit into a certain layout, or you have a large number of columns in the table, you can enable x-scrolling to show the table in a viewport, which can be scrolled. This property can by any CSS unit, or a number (in which case it will be treated as a pixel measurement).</td>
		        </tr>
			    <tr>
			      <td valign="top"><strong>sScrollY</strong> <br></td>
			      <td valign="top">Enable vertical scrolling. Vertical scrolling will constrain the DataTable to the given height, an enable scrolling for any data which overflows the current viewport. This can be used as an alternative to paging to display a lot of data in a small area (although paging and scrolling can both be enabled at the same time). This property can by any CSS unit, or a number (in which case it will be treated as a pixel measurement).</td>
		        </tr>
		      </tbody>
		  </table>

          <h5>Options</h5>
            <p>Where the DataTables features can be considered rough grain tuning of your DataTables integration, there are many other parameters which will let you obtain the fine grain tuning you might need to make the integration truly seamless. Almost every function that DataTables provides can be fine tuned in some manner using the initialisation options shown below.</p>
            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5">
              <tbody>
                <tr>
                  <td width="117" valign="top"><strong>aaData</strong> <br></td>
                  <td width="1682" valign="top">An array of data to use for the table, passed in at initialisation which will be used in preference to any data which is already in the DOM. This is particularly useful for constructing tables purely in Javascript, for example with a custom Ajax call.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td valign="top"><strong>aaSorting</strong> <br></td>
                  <td valign="top">If sorting is enabled, then DataTables will perform a first pass sort on initialisation. You can define which column(s) the sort is performed upon, and the sorting direction, with this variable. The aaSorting array should contain an array for each column to be sorted initially containing the column's index and a direction string ('asc' or 'desc').</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td valign="top"><strong>aaSortingFixed</strong></td>
                  <td valign="top">This parameter is basically identical to the aaSorting parameter, but cannot be overridden by user interaction with the table. What this means is that you could have a column (visible or hidden) which the sorting will always be forced on first - any sorting after that (from the user) will then be performed as required. This can be useful for grouping rows together.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td valign="top"><strong>aLengthMenu</strong> <br></td>
                  <td valign="top">This parameter allows you to readily specify the entries in the length drop down menu that DataTables shows when pagination is enabled. It can be either a 1D array of options which will be used for both the displayed option and the value, or a 2D array which will use the array in the first position as the value, and the array in the second position as the displayed options (useful for language strings such as 'All').</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td valign="top"><strong>aoSearchCols</strong> <br></td>
                  <td valign="top">Basically the same as oSearch, this parameter defines the individual column filtering state at initialisation time. The array must be of the same size as the number of columns, and each element be an object with the parameters "sSearch" and "bEscapeRegex" (the latter is optional). 'null' is also accepted and the default will be used.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td valign="top"><strong>asStripClasses</strong> <br></td>
                  <td valign="top">An array of CSS classes that should be applied to displayed rows. This array may be of any length, and DataTables will apply each class sequentially, looping when required.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td valign="top"><strong>bDestroy</strong> <br></td>
                  <td valign="top">Replace a DataTable which matches the given selector and replace it with one which has the properties of the new initialisation object passed. If no table matches the selector, then the new DataTable will be constructed as per normal.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td valign="top"><strong>bRetrieve</strong> <br></td>
                  <td valign="top">Retrieve the DataTables object for the given selector. Note that if the table has already been initialised, this parameter will cause DataTables to simply return the object that has already been set up - it will not take account of any changes you might have made to the initialisation object passed to DataTables (setting this parameter to true is an acknowledgement that you understand this). bDestroy can be used to reinitialise a table if you need.</td>

            <h4>Flot, flot pie, excanvas, order bars ( jquery.flot.js, jquery.flot.pie.js, excanvas.min.js etc. )</h4>

            <h5>Introduction</h5>
			<p>Flot is a pure Javascript plotting library for <a href="http://jquery.com/" rel="nofollow">jQuery</a>. It produces graphical <strong>plots</strong> of arbitrary datasets on-the-fly client-side.
			The focus is on <strong>simple</strong> usage (all settings are optional), <strong>attractive</strong> looks and <strong>interactive</strong> features like zooming and mouse tracking.
			<br>The plugin works with Internet Explorer 6+, Firefox 2.x+, Safari 3.0+, Opera 9.5+ and Konqueror 4.x+ with the HTML canvas tag (the <a href="http://excanvas.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">excanvas</a>Javascript emulation helper is used for IE &lt; 9).</p>

			<h5>Installation</h5>
            <p>Just include the Javascript file after you've included jQuery. Generally, all browsers that support the HTML5 canvas tag are supported. <br>For support for Internet Explorer &lt; 9, you can use Excanvas - a canvas emulator; this is used in the examples bundled with Flot. You just include the excanvas script like this: 
            <pre class="brush: css">&lt;!--[if lte IE 8]&gt;&lt;script language="javascript" type="text/javascript" src="excanvas.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;![endif]--&gt;</pre>
            If it's not working on your development IE 6.0, check that it has support for VML which Excanvas is relying on. It appears that some stripped down versions used for test environments on virtual machines lack the VML support.You can also try using Flashcanvas (see <a href="http://code.google.com/p/flashcanvas/">http://code.google.com/p/flashcanvas/</a>), which uses Flash to do the emulation. Although Flash can be a bit slower to load than VML, if you've got a lot of points, the Flash version can be much faster overall. Flot contains some wrapper code for activating Excanvas which Flashcanvas is compatible with.<br>You need at least jQuery 1.2.6, but try at least 1.3.2 for interactive charts because of performance improvements in event handling.</p>

            <h5>Basic usage</h5>
            <p>Create a placeholder div to put the graph in:
            <pre class="brush: css">&lt;div id="placeholder"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
            You need to set the width and height of this div, otherwise the plot library doesn't know how to scale the graph. You can do it inline like this:
            <pre class="brush: css">&lt;div id="placeholder" style="width:600px;height:300px"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
            You can also do it with an external stylesheet. Make sure that the placeholder isn't within something with a display:none CSS property - in that case, Flot has trouble measuring label dimensions which results in garbled looks and might have trouble measuring the placeholder dimensions which is fatal (it'll throw an exception). <br>Then when the div is ready in the DOM, which is usually on document ready, run the plot function:
            <pre class="brush: css">$.plot($("#placeholder"), data, options);</pre>
            Here, data is an array of data series and options is an object with settings if you want to customize the plot. Take a look at the examples for some ideas of what to put in or look at the reference in the file "API.txt". Here's a quick example that'll draw a line from (0, 0) to (1, 1):
            <pre class="brush: css">$.plot($("#placeholder"), [ [[0, 0], [1, 1]] ], { yaxis: { max: 1 } });</pre>
            The plot function immediately draws the chart and then returns a plot object with a couple of methods.

            <h4>WYSIHTML5 editor</h4>

            <h5>Usage</h5>
            <p><strong>wysihtml5 is an open source rich text editor based on HTML5 technology and the progressive-enhancement approach. It uses a sophisticated security concept and aims to generate fully valid HTML5 markup by preventing unmaintainable tag soups and inline styles.</p>
            
            <h5>Features</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>It's fast and lightweight (smaller than TinyMCE, Aloha, ...)</li>
                <li>Auto-linking of urls as-you-type</li>
                <li>Generates valid and semantic HTML5 markup (even when the content is pasted from MS Word)</li>
                <li>Uses class names instead of inline styles</li>
                <li>Unifies line break handling across browsers</li>
                <li>Uses sandboxed iframes in order to prevent identity theft through XSS</li>
                <li>Speech-input for Chrome</li>
                <li>No jQuery required</li>
            </ul>

            
            <h5>Basic usage</h5>

            <h6>1. Include scripts</h6>
            <ul>
                <li>The first script contains the html5 parser rules that are needed for wysihtml5 in order to create valid and desired markup.</li>
                <li>Either use one of the existing parser rules sets or create your own.</li>
                <li>Check the advanced.js parser rules for details.</li>
                <li>The second script is the minified wysihtml5 library. It’s located in the dist folder of this repository.</li>
            </ul>

            <pre class="brush: html">
                <!-- wysihtml5 parser rules -->
                &lt;script src="/path-to-wysihtml5/parser_rules/advanced.js">&lt;/script>
                <!-- Library -->
                &lt;script src="/path-to-wysihtml5/dist/wysihtml5-0.3.0.min.js">&lt;/script>          
            </pre>

            <h6>2. Create a textarea</h6>
            <p>
                wysihtml5 takes a textarea and transforms it into a rich text editor. The textarea acts as a fallback for unsupported browsers (eg. IE < 8). Make sure the textarea element has an id, so we can later access it easily from javascript.
                The resulting rich text editor will much behave and look like the textarea since behavior (placeholder, autofocus, …) and css styles will be copied over.

                <strong>Please note:</strong> The textarea will always hold the editor’s generated markup. Therefore wysihtml5 integrates smoothly with forms.
            </p>

            <pre class="brush: html">
                &lt;form>&lt;textarea id="wysihtml5-textarea" placeholder="Enter your text ..." autofocus>&lt;/textarea>&lt;/form>       
            </pre>


            <h6>3. Create a toolbar</h6>
            <p>
                The toolbar contains the formatting options. Make sure the toolbar element has an id and has display: none.

                <strong>Please note:</strong> wysihtml5 supports many more formatting commands
            </p>

            <pre class="brush: html">
                &lt;div id="wysihtml5-toolbar" style="display: none;">
                  &lt;a data-wysihtml5-command="bold">bold&lt;/a>
                  &lt;a data-wysihtml5-command="italic">italic&lt;/a>
                  
                  <!-- Some wysihtml5 commands require extra parameters -->
                  &lt;a data-wysihtml5-command="foreColor" data-wysihtml5-command-value="red">red&lt;/a>
                  &lt;a data-wysihtml5-command="foreColor" data-wysihtml5-command-value="green">green&lt;/a>
                  &lt;a data-wysihtml5-command="foreColor" data-wysihtml5-command-value="blue">blue&lt;/a>
                  
                  <!-- Some wysihtml5 commands like 'createLink' require extra paramaters specified by the user (eg. href) -->
                  &lt;a data-wysihtml5-command="createLink">insert link&lt;/a>
                  &lt;div data-wysihtml5-dialog="createLink" style="display: none;">
                    &lt;label>
                      Link:
                      &lt;input data-wysihtml5-dialog-field="href" value="http://" class="text">
                    &lt;/label>
                    &lt;a data-wysihtml5-dialog-action="save">OK&lt;/a> &lt;a data-wysihtml5-dialog-action="cancel">Cancel&lt;/a>
                  &lt;/div>
                &lt;/div>      
            </pre>


            <h6>4. Initialize wysihtml5</h6>
            <p>
                Make sure you place the <code>&lt;script></code> at the end of the document, before the <code>&lt;/body></code> tag because the document must be loaded before running the script. Or, test if document is loaded (i.e. jQuery’s $(document).ready()) and initialize the editor aferwards.
                    wysihtml5 supports many more configuration options.
            </p>

            <pre class="brush: js">
                var editor = new wysihtml5.Editor("wysihtml5-textarea", { // id of textarea element
                  toolbar:      "wysihtml5-toolbar", // id of toolbar element
                  parserRules:  wysihtml5ParserRules // defined in parser rules set 
                });
            </pre>

            <h4>Custom form elements ( uniform.js )</h4>

			<h5>Usage</h5>
            <p><strong>Uniform masks your standard form controls with custom themed controls. It works in sync with your real form elements to ensure accessibility and compatibility.</strong></p>
            
            <h5>Installation</h5>
            <p>Installation of Uniform is quite simple. First, make sure you have jQuery 1.3+ installed. Then you'll want to link to the jquery.uniform.js file and uniform.default.css in the head area of your page:</p>
            <pre class="brush: html">
            &lt;script src="jquery.uniform.js" type="text/javascript">&lt;/script>
            &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="uniform.default.css" type="text/css" media="screen" charset="utf-8" />
            </pre>
            
            <h5>Basic usage</h5>
            <p>Using Uniform can be quite easy as well. Simply call:</p>
            <pre class="brush: js">
            $(function(){ $("select").uniform(); });            
            </pre>
            <p>To "uniform" all possible form elements, just do something like this:</p>
            <pre class="brush: js">
            $("select, input:checkbox, input:radio, input:file").uniform();            
            </pre>
            
            <h5>Extra parameters</h5>
            <p>You can pass in extra parameters to control certain aspects of Uniform. To pass in parameters, use syntax like this:</p>
            <pre class="brush: js">
            $("select").uniform({
              param1: value,
              param2: value,
              param3: value
            });           
            </pre>
            
            <h5>Tips and tricks</h5>
            <p>Uniform is supposed to be pretty simple, but there are a few things that can be tricky. Here are some tips that may make your experience simpler:<br>
            Remember to change the CSS classes in the theme if you change the parameters for elements' classes. This can be tedious work, but if you don't do it, it's not going to look correct. Find and Replace is your friend.<br>
            Uniform cannot automatically sniff out dynamic value changes. If you make changes to elements in Javascript or using a Reset button of some kind remember to call $.uniform.update(); to sync the changes with Uniform.<br>
            Uniform is disabled in IE6. It's not possible to fix due to the way IE6 handles form elements. If you care about IE6 users, give it a quick look to make sure your "naked" form elements look alright in there.<br>
            You're on your own for styling text inputs and more. Fortunately, things that are not handled by Uniform are pretty easy to skin. :)<br>
            </p>

            <h4>Multiple file uploader (Plupload)</h4>
			<h5>Configuration</h5>
		    <p>Each plupload instance has a set of config options. Here is a short description about each available option.</p>
          
            <h5>General options</h5>
            <p>Here is a list of options that are available in the core API. Some of them are runtime specific. Checkout the <a href="http://www.plupload.com/example_custom.php">custom example</a>to see these option used live.</p>
            
            <h6>runtimes</h6>
            <p>This is a comma separated list of runtimes that you want to initialize the uploader instance with. It will try to initialize each runtime in order if one fails it will move on to the next one.</p>
            
            <h6>url</h6>
            <p>Page URL to where the files will be uploaded to.
            
            <h6>max_file_size</h6>
            <p>Maximum file size that the user can pick. This string can be in the following formats 100b, 10kb, 10mb.</p>
            
            <h6>chunk_size</h6>
            <p>Enables you to chunk the file into smaller pieces for example if your PHP backend has a max post size of 1MB you can chunk a 10MB file into 10 requests. To <strong>disable</strong> chunking, remove this config option from your setup.</p>
            
            <h6>unique_names</h6>
            <p>Generate unique filenames when uploading. This will generate unqiue filenames for the files so that they don't for example collide with existing ones on the server.</p>
            
            <h6>resize</h6>
            <p>Enables plupload to resize the images to clientside to the specified width, height and quality. Set this to an object with those parameters.</p>
            
            <h6>filters</h6>
            <p>List of filters to apply when the user selects files. This is currently file extension filters there are two items for each filter. title and extensions.</p>
            <h6>flash_swf_url</h6>
            <p>URL to where the SWF file is for the Flash runtime.</p>
            <h6>silverlight_xap_url</h6>
            <p>URL to where the XAP file is for the Silverlight runtime.</p>
            <h6>browse_button</h6>

            <h4>Fullcalendar plugin</h4>
			<p> FullCalendar is a <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> plugin that provides a <strong>full-sized</strong>, <strong>drag &amp; drop</strong> calendar like the one below. It uses AJAX to fetch events on-the-fly for each month and is easily configured to use your own feed format (an extension is provided for<strong>Google Calendar</strong>). It is visually customizable and exposes hooks for user-triggered events (like clicking or dragging an event). It is open source and dual licensed under the <a href="http://arshaw.com/js/fullcalendar-1.5.2/MIT-LICENSE.txt">MIT</a> or <a href="http://arshaw.com/js/fullcalendar-1.5.2/GPL-LICENSE.txt">GPL</a> Version 2 licenses. </p>
            
            <h5>Basic Usage</h5>
            <p>The first step in embedding a calendar on a web page is to have the right JavaScript and CSS files. Make sure you are including the FullCalendar stylesheet, as well as the FullCalendar and <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> JS files, in the &lt;head&gt; of your page:</p>
            <pre class="brush: html">
                &lt;link rel='stylesheet' type='text/css' href='fullcalendar.css' /&gt;  
                &lt;script type='text/javascript' src='jquery.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;  
                &lt;script type='text/javascript' src='fullcalendar.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;  
            </pre>
            <p>If you plan on doing dragging or resizing, you need some additional <a href="http://jqueryui.com/download">jQuery UI</a> files (more information <a href="http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/docs/event_ui/Requirements/">here</a>).</p>
            <p>Once you have your dependencies, you need to write the JavaScript code that initializes the calendar. This code must be executed <em>after</em> the page has initialized. The best way to do this is with jQuery's $(document).ready like so:</p>
            <pre class="brush: js"> 
            $(document).ready(function() {      
            
                // page is now ready, initialize the calendar...       
                $('#calendar').fullCalendar({          
                
                    // put your options and callbacks here      
                
                })    
            }); 
            </pre>
            
            <h5>Options</h5>
            <p>Most of FullCalendar's documentation describes options that affect the look or behavior of the calendar. Options are usually set when the calendar is initialized, like so:</p>
            <pre class="brush: js">
                $('#calendar').fullCalendar({
                    weekends: false // will hide Saturdays and Sundays
                });
            </pre>
            
            <h5>Callbacks</h5>
            <p>Callbacks are sort of like options, but they are <em>functions</em> that get <em>called</em> whenever something special happens. In the following example, an alert box will appear whenever the user clicks on a day:</p>
            <pre class="brush: js">
                $('#calendar').fullCalendar({
                    dayClick: function() {
                        alert('a day has been clicked!');
                    }
                });
            </pre>
            
            <h5>Methods</h5>
            <p> Methods provide ways to manipulate the calendar from JavaScript code. A method operates on the jQuery object of a calendar that has already been initialized, using the familiar fullCalendar command, but in a completely different way: </p>
            <pre class="brush: js">
                $('#calendar').fullCalendar('next');
            </pre>
            <p>This will call the next method and will force to the calendar to move to the next month/week/day.</p>
            <p class="warning"><strong>Note:</strong> Original documentation for this plugin you can find on official plugin's website: <a href="http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/docs/usage/" target="_blank">http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/docs/usage/</a></p>

            <h4>Mousewheel plugin</h4>
            <h5>Introduction</h5>
            <p>A jQuery plugin that adds cross-browser mouse wheel support.
            In order to use the plugin, simply bind the "mousewheel" event to an element. It also provides two helper methods called mousewheel and unmousewheel that act just like other event helper methods in jQuery. The event callback receives an extra argument which is the normalized "delta" of the mouse wheel.</p>
            
            <h5>Example usage</h5>
            <pre class="brush: js">
                // using bind
                $('#my_elem').bind('mousewheel', function(event, delta) {

            <h4>Bootstrap Hover Dropdown Plugin</h4>
            <h5>Introduction</h5>
            <p>A simple plugin to enable Bootstrap dropdowns to activate on hover and provide a nice user experience.
                The dropdowns are dismissed after a configurable delay. This fixes an issue that can instantly close your nav because of a 1px gap between the button/nav item that activated the dropdown and the actual dropdown. It is also generally a better user experience, as users are not punished by going 1 pixel outside of the dropdown, which would instantly close the nav without a delay.
                <strong>Note:</strong> The HTML markup is the same as with any other Bootstrap dropdown. This will not interfere with Bootstrap's default activate-on-click method (i.e. this plugin combined with Bootstrap's default behavior work well to support both the ideal experience on desktop and mobile).
            </p>
            
            <h5>Installation</h5>
            <p>Once you have the files downloaded, link to the files in your code after you include the main Bootstrap JS file(s):</p>
            <pre class="brush: js">
                <!-- script order matters! -->
                &lt;script src="/path/to/jquery.min.js">&lt;/script>
                &lt;script src="/path/to/bootstrap.min.js">&lt;/script>
                &lt;script src="/path/to/bootstrap-hover-dropdown.min.js">&lt;/script>          
            </pre>

            <h5>Usage</h5>
            <p>Just like in Bootstrap you can activate it without any JavaScript, just by adding a data-attribute, you can make it automatically work.
                Add <code>data-hover="dropdown"</code> in addition (or in place of) Bootstrap's <code>data-toggle="dropdown"</code>.
                You can set options via data-attributes, too, via <code>data-delay</code> and <code>data-close-others</code>. Here's an example of markup:
            </p>
            <pre class="brush: html">
                &lt;li class="dropdown">
                    &lt;a href="#" class="dropdown-toggle" data-toggle="dropdown" data-hover="dropdown" data-delay="1000" data-close-others="false">
                        Account &lt;b class="caret">&lt;/b>
                    &lt;/a>
                    &lt;ul class="dropdown-menu">
                        &lt;li>&lt;a tabindex="-1" href="#">My Account&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
                        &lt;li class="divider">&lt;/li>
                        &lt;li>&lt;a tabindex="-1" href="#">Change Email&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
                        &lt;li>&lt;a tabindex="-1" href="#">Change Password&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
                        &lt;li class="divider">&lt;/li>
                        &lt;li>&lt;a tabindex="-1" href="#">Logout&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
                    &lt;/ul>
                &lt;/li>       
            </pre>

            <p>Alternatively, you can initialize via JavaScript:</p>

            <pre class="brush: js">
                $('.dropdown-toggle').dropdownHover(options);    
            </pre>
            
            <p>This also works with submenus without any other configuring since Bootstrap already supports this feature. Just use the markup like you were using before. Only the top level anchor tag needs any special markup for my plugin to work (see demo for proper markup).</p>
  
            <h5>Options</h5>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>delay:</strong> (optional) The delay in miliseconds. This is the time to wait before closing a dropdown when the mouse is no longer over the dropdown or the button/nav item that activated it. Defaults to 500.</li>
            <li><strong>instantlyCloseOthers:</strong> (optional) A boolean value that when true, will instantly close all other dropdowns matched by the selector used when you activate a new navigation. This is nice for when you have dropdowns close together that may overlap. Default is true.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Tabletools</h4>
            <h5>Introduction</h5>
            <p>
                TableTools is a plug-in for the DataTables HTML table enhancer, which adds a highly customisable button toolbar to a DataTable. Key features include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Copy to clipboard</li>
                    <li>Save table data as CSV, XLS or PDF files</li>
                    <li>Print view for clean printing</li>
                    <li>Row selection options</li>
                    <li>Easy use predefined buttons</li>
                    <li>Simple customisation of buttons</li>
                    <li>Well defined API for advanced control</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            
            <h5>Initialisation</h5>
            <p>Initialisation of TableTools is typically done at the same time as the initialisation of DataTables through the sDom and oTableTools properties. Customisation of TableTools is done through the properties of the oTableTools object - a full list of the options available is provided before. It is also possible to initialise TableTools directly, which can be useful when you want an easy reference to the instance, or to place the toolbar outside the DataTables DOM structure.</p>
            <pre class="brush: js">
                /*
                 * Example initialisation
                 */
                $(document).ready( function () {
                    $('#example').dataTable( {
                        "sDom": 'T&lt;"clear">lfrtip',
                        "oTableTools": {
                            "sSwfPath": "/swf/copy_csv_xls_pdf.swf"
                        }
                    } );
                } );       
            </pre>

            <h5>DataTables properties</h5>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>aButtons</strong> - This parameter defined the buttons that TableTools will use and provides the primary focus for customisation of TableTools. In it's basic form the elements of this array are strings which match the predefined buttons, but the elements can also be objects which define your own buttons, or override the default actions.</li>

                <li><strong>fnPreRowSelect</strong> - This is a callback function which is fired just prior to a row being selected (i.e. the mouse down has occurred, but TableTools has not yet selected the row). It can be used to cancel the selection if needed</li>

                <li><strong>fnRowDeselected</strong> - Callback function which is called when a row is deselected (i.e. the opposite of fnRowSelected).</li>
                
                <li><strong>fnRowSelected</strong> - Callback function which occurs when a row is selected. This allows a particular action to occur when any row is selected (a selected row counter for example).</li>

                <li><strong>sRowSelect</strong> - TableTools provides everything that is needed to allow the end user to select rows in a table (by clicking on them). This is disabled by default, but can be readily enabled by setting this property to either "single" (to allow only one row in the table to be selected at a time), "multi" (to allow any number of rows to be selected) or "os" (to provide operating system like row selection including cmd/ctrl and shift select).</li>
                
                <li><strong>sSelectedClass</strong> - Set the class used to indicate that a row has been selected by the end user.</li>

                <li><strong>sSwfPath</strong> - Define the path of the SWF to be used by TableTools for copy to clipboard and saving a file locally operations. If you are having problems with these operations, but not printing, this is very likely to be the issue.</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>Initialisation parameters</h5>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>oTableTools</strong> - To customise the TableTools options through the DataTables initialisation object, you can make use of this parameter. Any of the options given in the "Initialisation parameters" section below can be used here.</li>
                <li><strong>sDom</strong> - The sDom parameter in DataTables is used to position the various controls that DataTables adds to the table (filtering, paging etc) in the DOM. This will directly effect the position of the elements in the display, when combined with your CSS. TableTools can be included by inserting the character 'T' into sDom. This is all that is needed to initialise TableTools - everything is options and customisation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>jQuery validation plugin</h4>
            <h5>Introduction</h5>
            <p>This jQuery plugin makes simple clientside form validation easy, whilst still offering plenty of customization options. It makes a good choice if you’re building something new from scratch, but also when you’re trying to integrate something into an existing application with lots of existing markup. The plugin comes bundled with a useful set of validation methods, including URL and email validation, while providing an API to write your own methods. All bundled methods come with default error messages in english and translations into 37 other languages.</p>
            
            <h5>Default usage</h5>
            <strong>Field validations</strong>

            <p>You may need different ways to specify validation rules according to the server-side enviroment you are using on different projects:
            <pre class="brush: html">
                &lt;form class="cmxform" id="commentForm" method="get" action="">
                  &lt;fieldset>
                    &lt;legend>Please provide your name, email address (won't be published) and a comment&lt;/legend>
                    &lt;p>
                      &lt;label for="cname">Name (required, at least 2 characters)&lt;/label>
                      &lt;input id="cname" name="name" minlength="2" type="text" required/>
                    &lt;/p>
                    &lt;p>
                      &lt;label for="cemail">E-Mail (required)&lt;/label>
                      &lt;input id="cemail" type="email" name="email" required/>
                    &lt;/p>
                    &lt;p>
                      &lt;label for="curl">URL (optional)&lt;/label>
                      &lt;input id="curl" type="url" name="url"/>
                    &lt;/p>
                    &lt;p>
                      &lt;label for="ccomment">Your comment (required)&lt;/label>
                      &lt;textarea id="ccomment" name="comment" required>&lt;/textarea>
                    &lt;/p>
                    &lt;p>
                      &lt;input class="submit" type="submit" value="Submit"/>
                    &lt;/p>
                  &lt;/fieldset>
                &lt;/form>
                &lt;script>
                $("#commentForm").validate();
                &lt;/script>
            </pre>
            A single line of jQuery to select the form and apply the validation plugin, plus a few annotations on each element to specify the validation rules.

            Of course that isn't the only way to specify rules. You also don't have to rely on those default messages, but they come in handy when starting to setup validation for a form.
            </p>


            <h6>Validator</h6>

            <p>The validate method returns a Validator object that has a few public methods that you can use to trigger validation programmatically or change the contents of the form. The validator object has more methods, but only those documented here are intended for usage.</p>

            <ul>
            <li>Validator.form() – Validates the form.</li>
            <li>Validator.element() – Validates a single element.</li>
            <li>Validator.resetForm() – Resets the controlled form.</li>
            <li>Validator.showErrors() – Show the specified messages.</li>
            <li>Validator.numberOfInvalids() – Returns the number of invalid fields.</li>
            </ul>

            There are a few static methods on the validator object:

            <ul>
            <li>jQuery.validator.addMethod() – Add a custom validation method.</li>
            <li>jQuery.validator.format() – Replaces {n} placeholders with arguments.</li>
            <li>jQuery.validator.setDefaults() – Modify default settings for validation.</li>
            <li>jQuery.validator.addClassRules() – Add a compound class method.</li>
            </ul>

            
            <h5>Validation methods</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>required – Makes the element required.</li>
                <li>remote – Requests a resource to check the element for validity.</li>
                <li>minlength – Makes the element require a given minimum length.</li>
                <li>maxlength – Makes the element require a given maxmimum length.</li>
                <li>rangelength – Makes the element require a given value range.</li>
                <li>min – Makes the element require a given minimum.</li>
                <li>max – Makes the element require a given maximum.</li>
                <li>range – Makes the element require a given value range.</li>
                <li>email – Makes the element require a valid email</li>
                <li>url – Makes the element require a valid url</li>
                <li>date – Makes the element require a date.</li>
               <li>dateISO – Makes the element require an ISO date.</li>
               <li> number – Makes the element require a decimal number.</li>
                <li>digits – Makes the element require digits only.</li>
                <li>creditcard – Makes the element require a credit card number.</li>
                <li>equalTo – Requires the element to be the same as another one</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Date Range Picker for Bootstrap</h4>
            <h5>Introduction</h5>
            <p>This date range picker component for Bootstrap creates a dropdown menu from which a user can select a range of dates. I created it while building the UI for Improvely, which needed a way to select date ranges for reports.
            If invoked with no options, it will present two calendars to choose a start and end date from. Optionally, you can provide a list of date ranges the user can select from instead of choosing dates from the calendars. If attached to a text input, the selected dates will be inserted into the text box. Otherwise, you can provide a custom callback function to receive the selection.</p>
            
            <h5>Default usage</h5>

            <p>This component relies on Bootstrap, Moment.js and jQuery.
                Separate stylesheets are included for use with Bootstrap 2 or Bootstrap 3.
                Basic usage:
            <pre class="brush: html">
                &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.js">&lt;/script>
                &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="moment.js">&lt;/script>
                &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="daterangepicker.js">&lt;/script>
                &lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="bootstrap.css" />
                &lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="daterangepicker-bs3.css" />

                &lt;script type="text/javascript">
                $(document).ready(function() {
                  $('input[name="daterange"]').daterangepicker();
                });
                &lt;/script>
            </pre>
           
            The constructor also takes an optional options object and callback function. The function will be called whenever the selected date range has been changed by the user, and is passed the start and end dates (moment date objects) as parameters. It will not fire if the picker is closed without any change to the selected dates.

            <pre class="brush: js">
                $('input[name="daterange"]').daterangepicker(
                  { 
                    format: 'YYYY-MM-DD',
                    startDate: '2013-01-01',
                    endDate: '2013-12-31'
                  },
                  function(start, end) {
                    alert('A date range was chosen: ' + start.format('YYYY-MM-DD') + ' to ' + end.format('YYYY-MM-DD'));
                  }
                );
            </pre>
            </p>


            <h6>Options</h6>
            <ul>

                <li><code>singleDatePicker:</code> (boolean) Show only a single calendar to choose one date, instead of a range picker with two calendars; the start and end dates provided to your callback will be the same single date chosen</li>
            </ul>

            <h6>Functions</h6>

            <p>Several functions are provided for updating the picker's option and state after initialization:</p>

            <ul>
            <li><code>setOptions(object, function):</code> This function has the same signature and purpose as the date range picker's constructor: it sets the picker's options to their defaults, overrides them with any values in an options object you provide, and sets the callback for selection changes to whatever function you provide</li>
            <li><code>setStartDate(Date/moment/string):</code> Sets the date range picker's currently selected start date to the provided date</li>
            <li><code>setEndDate(Date/moment/string):</code> Sets the date range picker's currently selected end date to the provided date</li>          
            </ul>


            <h6>Events</h6>

            <p>Several events are triggered on the element you attach the picker to, which you can listen for:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><code>show:</code> Triggered when the picker is shown</li>
                <li><code>hide:</code> Triggered when the picker is hidden</li>
                <li><code>apply:</code> Triggered when the apply button is clicked</li>
                <li><code>cancel:</code> Triggered when the cancel button is clicked</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Some applications need a "clear" instead of a "cancel" functionality, which can be achieved by changing the button label and watching for the cancel event:</p>

            <pre class="brush: js">
                $('#daterange').daterangepicker({
                  locale: { cancelLabel: 'Clear' }  
                });

                $('#daterange').on('cancel', function(ev, picker) {
                  //do something, like clearing an input
                  $('#daterange').val('');
                });
            </pre>

            <p>While passing in a callback to the constructor is the easiest way to listen for changes in the selected date range, you can also do something every time the apply button is clicked even if the selection hasn't changed:</p>

            <pre class="brush: js">
                $('#daterange').daterangepicker();
                $('#daterange').on('apply', function(ev, picker) {
                  console.log(picker.startDate.format('YYYY-MM-DD'));
                  console.log(picker.endDate.format('YYYY-MM-DD'));
                });
            </pre>

            <p>I didn't add to this documentation file any docs or explanations for Bootstrap plugins, because i won't describe it more detailed than official Bootstrap website will.</p>
            <p>I kept original Bootstrap markup for all elements in html and css files, however some elements require additional classes like buttons with caret dropdown for proper alignment and others, but not too many. In general everything is equal to original markup.</p>

            <p>Please note - i tried to style almost all bootstrap elements, but anyway i didn't use these components:
